## 🎯 Overview

**Halo** is a plug-and-drop distributed security observability platform built in Rust. Deploy it on your server and let it seamlessly integrate with your entire infrastructure — NGINX servers, Tailscale nodes, Fortinet firewalls, and more. Think of it as a next-generation Graylog alternative with native support for modern security tools and zero-trust networking.

**One console to monitor, visualize, and enforce zero-trust posture across your entire ecosystem.**

### Key Features

- 🔌 **Plug & Play Deployment** — Drop Halo on a server and watch it connect to your infrastructure
- 🛡️ **Multi-Source Security Aggregation** — CrowdSec, Wazuh, Fortinet firewalls, NGINX logs, and more
- 🌐 **Zero-Trust Network Integration** — Native Tailscale and Headscale support
- 📊 **Advanced Log Management** — Modern Graylog alternative with better performance
- 🦀 **Built with Rust** — High performance, memory-safe, and reliable
- 🔄 **Real-Time Telemetry** — Prometheus metrics and live event streaming

---

## 🧠 Architecture

### Halo Core (Rust)

Async daemon that collects telemetry via WebSocket, Kafka, or REST and exposes a unified `/metrics` and `/events` API.

### Modular "Eyes" System

- **halo-wazuh** — Polls Wazuh REST API for security events
- **halo-crowdsec** — Subscribes to CrowdSec LAPI stream for threat intelligence
- **halo-prom** — Prometheus metrics scraper
- **halo-nginx** — Tails NGINX access/error logs in real-time
- **halo-firewall** — Monitors Fortinet firewalls and nftables events
- **halo-tailscale** — Integrates with Tailscale via `tailscale status --json`
- **halo-proxmox** — Reads Proxmox VE cluster events

### Data Pipeline

Aggregates and forwards events to:
- Graylog
- Loki
- Elasticsearch
- Custom backends

### UI Layer *(Coming Soon)*

Modern dashboard built with Tauri + Leptos or React for real-time visualization and control.
